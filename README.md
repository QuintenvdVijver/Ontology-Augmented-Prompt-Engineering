# Ontology-Augmented Prompt Engineering for Aspectâ€“Based Sentiment Classification
This code can be used to conduct ontology prompt injection into various LLM models. Models we used were GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4o mini, Llama-3-70B Instruct, and Llama-4-Scout-17B-16E Instruct.

## Before running the code
- Set up environment:
  - Set up your Google Collab (or something similar) with Python 3.10
  - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal
- Set up data:
  - The data and ontologies can be found at `Data/Raw SemEval data` & `Data/Domain ontologies`
  - Use the `full_ontology_verbalization.py` file to verbalize the ontologies

## Training and validating process
